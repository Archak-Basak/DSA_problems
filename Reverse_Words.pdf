Given an input string "s", reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.



Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

Example 2:

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

Example 3:

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.


Code:

import java.util.*;


class Reverse_Words{
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.trim().split("\\s+");

        int l = 0, r = words.length - 1;
        while(l < r) {
            String t = words[l];
            words[l] = words[r];
            words[r] = t;
            l++;
            r--;
        }
        String revStr = String.join(" ", words);

        return revStr;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner ab = new Scanner(System.in);
        String str = ab.nextLine().trim();

        Reverse_Words res = new Reverse_Words(str);
        System.out.println(res);
        ab.close();
    }
}
